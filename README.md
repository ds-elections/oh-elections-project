#About Our Project:

A data project looking at demographical discrepensies in voting in Ohio. By comparing exit polling, national surveys, and voter file data, we hope to examine discrepensies in who says they vote versus who actually votes in Ohio. Specifically, we plan to look at age and party identification, with the option to expand our variables if anything else jumps out at us as majorly skewed or important. By looking at demographic information for the last three election cycles, both primary and general, we should get a better understanding of what the voter pool in a hotly contested state, eventually leading to better polling and better predictive models for future elections.
